# C-Projects
Things I did when I was doing C++

Rens TrainingWheels was something I made for my current job at the time. It helped organized my data entry information so I could just copy and paste it in the machine.

Trolls vs Humans was the first game I made. It is a simple command line game where you, the player, grind for levels and defeat the big boss, Troll.

The rest are lab assignments.
